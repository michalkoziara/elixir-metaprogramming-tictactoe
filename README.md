## Tic-Tac-Toe game done with Elixir macros

### Terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that uses metaprogramming with macros.

The goal of this project is to compare the metaprogramming capabilities of Elixir and C++ languages.

This repository contains only source code related to the metaprogramming capabilities in Elixir. 

The repository containing source code related to C++ can be found in the [michalkoziara/cpp-metaprogramming-tictactoe](https://github.com/michalkoziara/cpp-metaprogramming-tictactoe) repository.
